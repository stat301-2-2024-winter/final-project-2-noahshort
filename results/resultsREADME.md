## Stat 301-2 Final Project - Results

This repo is dedicated to the results from my final project for Statistics 301-2. The results are entirely rda files used from script to script, and eventually in the final report

If a result is connected to a specific R script, its numeric is in parentheses

`basketball_results_plot.rda` - plot of predicted vs true values for the outcome variable when the best model was fitted to the testing set (6)

`basketball_test_metrics.rda` - table of metric results from fitting the final model to the testing set (6)

`best_models_table.rda` - table of the best model + parameters for each model to compare results (5)

`boost_tuned_bio.rda` and `boost_tuned_stats.rda` - tuning results for boosted tree models (4)

`en_tuned_bio.rda` and `en_tuned_stats.rda` - tuning results for elastic net models (4)

`final_fit.rda` - fit results when fitting the final lm model to the entire training set (6)

`imputed_missingness.rda` - missing variables report for the final workable data set after imputation (1.5)

`knn_tuned_bio.rda` and `knn_tuned_stats.rda` - tuning results for k nearest neighbors models (4)

`lm_fit_bio.rda` and `lm_fit_stats.rda` - fit results for linear models (4)

`lm_fit_memo.rda` and `lm_rmse_memo.rda` - linear model results used in Memo 2 

`missing_report_predictor.rda` - missing variables report for memo 2

`null_fit_memo.rda` and `null_rmse_memo.rda` - null model results used in Memo 2

`null_fit.rda` - results of null model fit (4)

`rf_tuned_bio.rda` and `rf_tuned_stats.rda` - tuning results for random forest models (4)
